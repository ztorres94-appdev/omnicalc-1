# Omnicalc 1

Dynamic web applications are more interesting than static websites for one reason: **user input.** Let's finally learn how to let our users give us input!

### [Here is the target we will ultimately build.](https://omnicalc-1.matchthetarget.com/)

## Setup

1. Start the web server by running `bin/server`.
1. Navigate to your live application preview.
1. As you work, remember to navigate to `/git` and **commit often as you work.**
1. Run `rails grade` as often as you like to see how you are doing, but **make sure you test your app manually first to make sure it matches the target's behavior first**.

## Forms

**Our users don't want to type input into the address bar; they want to type into forms!**

The way it should work is:

 - If I visit the ROUTE `/square/new`, I should see a form with a label and an input to enter a number.
    - If I submit that form, I should see the square of the number that I entered.
 - If I visit the ROUTE `/square_root/new`, I should see a form with a label and an input to enter a number.
    - If I submit that form, I should see the square root of the number that I entered.
 - If I visit the ROUTE `/payment/new`, I should see a form with labels and inputs to enter three values:
    - The APR (annual percentage rate).
    - The number of _years_ remaining.
    - The present value.
    - If I submit that form, I should see the **monthly** payment due given the values that I entered.
    - Mind your units! Use the formula located in the file `payment_formula.gif` Hintin the same folder as this README.
    - Hint 1: The number of periods, `n`, that we receive from the user is in years. Since we're calculating monthly payment we multiply it by 12.
    - Hint 2: `apr` comes in as a string. We should turn it into a float and divide the number by 100 to get the percentage.
    - Hint 3: `r` in the formula is a percentage per period.  One period is equal to one month.  The `apr` we receive from the user is yearly.
    - Hint 4: Create a variable for the numerator and another one for the denominator.  If they are instance variables, you can view them within your view page. If your output does not match the target, having done this  will make debugging much more manageable.

        ![Payment formula](payment_formula.gif)
 - If I visit the ROUTE `/random/new`, I should see a form with labels and inputs to enter two numbers, a minimum and a maximum.
    - If I submit that form, I should see a random number that falls between the numbers that I entered.

Play around and try various inputs in [the target](http://omnicalc-1.matchthetarget.com/) to see examples of how each form should behave.

### Valid, accessible forms

**In order for your tests to pass**, you must build _valid_ forms (your Chrome browser _may_ tolerate invalid forms while you are manually testing, but automated test suites reject invalid forms):

 - Each `<input>` in the form must have a unique `id=""` attribute.
 - The `<label>` associated with the `<input>` should have a `for=""` attribute that matches the value of the `<input>`'s `id`.
 - The copy within the `<label>` must exactly match the target — spelling, capitalization, and punctuation matter for labels.
 - The same goes for the copy on the button to submit the form.
 - Any invalid HTML within a form will cause the test to fail, e.g. an orphaned closing `</div>` tag. Keep your code neatly indented to help avoid this.

An example of a valid form; in particular, notice the `id=""` and `for=""` attributes:

```html
<form action="/random/results">
  <div>
    <label for="min_input">
      Minimum
    </label>

    <input id="min_input" type="text" name="user_min" placeholder="E.g. 1.5">
  </div>

  <div>
    <label for="max_input">
      Maximum
    </label>

    <input id="max_input" type="text" name="user_max" placeholder="E.g. 4.5">
  </div>

  <button>
    Pick random number
  </button>
</form>
```

#### Additional Hints

The `to_s` method can format Floats [in more specific ways](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/853) that help us easily display data in a variety of ways.

In particular these two:

- [`.to_s(:currency) `](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/853#currency)
- [`.to_s(:percentage) `](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/853#percentage)

could be useful when formating the output of the payment form.
